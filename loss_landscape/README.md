## Result Summary

...

## Research Reports

 1. Implemented Loss Landscape vizualization for different model architectures (normal, deep and wide models) for CKIDS.
 2. The result graphs for the three models are in the presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DJMzC9De-lzFOj6BUmI0dy-Iwa8CcvQehBLKGMzDNBg/edit?usp=sharing
 3. Th python notebook - tf_model_loss.ipynb is to generate and train the model.
 4.The Python Notebook - loss_landscape_tf.ipynb is to generate the loss landscape implemented from https://github.com/tomgoldstein/loss-landscape
